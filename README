i>clicker Moodle integrate
==========================
This is the Moodle i>clicker integrate plugin which integrates Moodle with iClicker (http://www.iclicker.com/dnn/) The plugin (block) allows students to register their clickers with the Moodle installation. It provides an adminstrative interface for managing the registrations for Moodle admins. Instructors are provided with a reporting view which allows them to view a listing of the students in their courses which have and have not registered clickers.
